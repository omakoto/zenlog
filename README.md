# Zenlog — automatic per-command shell logging

Zenlog wraps your login shell and silently saves every command's output to its
own log file, tagged with metadata (directory, git branch, timestamps, etc.).
No more `tee`, no more scrollback hunting.

- *This documentation is in BETA -- it was made with Claude and not fully reviewed yet.*
- *This documentation also covers features that I haven't used myself for a long time, such as `ALT-3` and `ALT-4`. Some features may have bugs.*

## What you can do with it

| Want to… | How |
|---|---|
| Re-read the last command's output | Press `ALT+1` on the prompt (opens in `$ZENLOG_VIEWER`, default: `less`) |
| View it with full color in a browser | Press `ALT+2` (converts ANSI → HTML via `a2h`, opens in `$ZENLOG_RAW_VIEWER`, default: `google-chrome`; install `a2h` with `go install github.com/omakoto/a2h@latest`) |
| Pick any recent output interactively | Press `ALT+3` / `ALT+4` (uses `fzf`) |
| Insert a log filename into your command | Press `ALT+L` at any cursor position |
| Find URLs in recent output | `zenlog open-url` (picks with `fzf`, opens in `$ZENLOG_BROWSER`, default: `google-chrome`) |
| Grep old output from `lsusb` | `grep … ~/zenlog/cmds/lsusb/SAN/` |
| Check what `make` printed last week | `less ~/zenlog/cmds/make/S` (symlink to latest) |
| Clean up old logs | `zenlog purge-log -p 30 -y` |
| Change which viewer/browser is used | Set `ZENLOG_VIEWER`, `ZENLOG_RAW_VIEWER`, `ZENLOG_BROWSER` in `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` (see [Configuration](#configuration-zenlogtoml)) |

## Quick start

### 1. Install

*Zenlog can't be installed with `go install` because it requires commands in `subcommands/` to have a `+x` bit set, which `go install` won't do. Use `git clone`, and _do not_ remove the source files.*

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/src"
cd "$HOME/src"
git clone https://github.com/omakoto/zenlog.git
./zenlog/scripts/install.sh
export ZENLOG_SRC_DIR="$HOME/src/zenlog/"   # add this to your .*shrc too
```

### 2. Initialize

```bash
zenlog init
```

This creates `~/.zenlog.toml` and adds the setup hook to your `.bashrc` or
`.zshrc`.  The hook does **not** start zenlog automatically — it only wires up
the helper functions and hotkeys.

### 3. Start a session

```bash
zenlog
```

You're now in a logged shell.  Run any command, then press `ALT+1` to open its
output.  Type `exit` (or `exit 13` to restart zenlog) to leave the session.

> **Note (Bash):** Zenlog requires Bash 4.4+ for the `PS0` preexec hook.
> Run `bash --version` to check.

## Configuration: `~/.zenlog.toml`

`zenlog init` creates `~/.zenlog.toml`. Edit it as you like.

Key settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ZENLOG_DIR` | `$HOME/zenlog/` | Where log files are stored |
| `ZENLOG_START_COMMAND` | `exec $SHELL -l` | Shell started by `zenlog` |
| `ZENLOG_ALWAYS_NO_LOG_COMMANDS` | `vim`, `man`, `emacs`, `zenlog*`, … | Commands whose output is never saved |
| `ZENLOG_PREFIX_COMMANDS` | `sudo`, `time`, `command`, … | Prefixes stripped when determining the command name |
| `ZENLOG_AUTO_FLUSH` | `false` | Flush log files after every line (slow) |

Environment variables to set in `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`:

| Variable | Default | Used by | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ZENLOG_VIEWER` | `less` | `ALT+1`, `ALT+3`, `open-last-log`, … | Viewer for sanitized (text) logs |
| `ZENLOG_RAW_VIEWER` | `google-chrome` | `ALT+2`, `ALT+4` | Viewer for colorized HTML logs (requires `a2h`) |
| `ZENLOG_BROWSER` | `$BROWSER` → `google-chrome` | `open-url` | Browser for opening URLs found in logs |
| `ZENLOG_NO_DEFAULT_PROMPT` | — | shell prompt | Set to `1` to disable the post-command status line |
| `ZENLOG_NO_DEFAULT_BINDING` | — | shell | Set to `1` to disable the `ALT+*` hotkeys |

The viewer/browser variables are read at the time you actually open a log, so
they can appear anywhere in your RC file.  The `ZENLOG_NO_DEFAULT_*` variables
are checked when the setup line runs, so they **must** be set before it:

```bash
# Must be before the setup line:
export ZENLOG_NO_DEFAULT_BINDING=1
export ZENLOG_NO_DEFAULT_PROMPT=1

. <(zenlog basic-bash-setup)   # setup line

# These can be before or after:
export ZENLOG_VIEWER=bat
export ZENLOG_RAW_VIEWER=firefox
export ZENLOG_BROWSER=firefox
```

---

## Hotkeys (inside a zenlog session)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `ALT+1` | Open last command output with `$ZENLOG_VIEWER` |
| `ALT+2` | Open last command output in browser with color (requires `a2h`) |
| `ALT+3` | Pick any recent log with fzf, open with `$ZENLOG_VIEWER` |
| `ALT+4` | Pick any recent log with fzf, open in browser with color |
| `ALT+L` | Insert last log filename at cursor (repeat to cycle older logs) |

---

## Log file structure

```
$ZENLOG_DIR/
├── SAN/YEAR/MM/DD/          # Sanitized (ANSI-stripped) — good for grep
├── RAW/YEAR/MM/DD/          # Raw output (with ANSI color codes)
├── ENV/YEAR/MM/DD/          # Metadata: pwd, git branch, exec time, …
│
├── cmds/
│   ├── cat/
│   │   ├── SAN/YEAR/…       # Sanitized logs for every "cat" invocation
│   │   ├── RAW/…
│   │   ├── ENV/…
│   │   ├── S                # Symlink → most recent sanitized log
│   │   ├── SS               # Symlink → second most recent
│   │   ├── R, RR, …         # Same for RAW
│   │   └── E, EE, …         # Same for ENV
│   ├── ls/
│   └── …
│
├── pids/PID/                # Per-session logs (same structure as cmds/)
├── tags/TAG/                # Per-tag logs (see "Log tagging" below)
│
├── S, SS, SSS, …            # Global most-recent sanitized logs (any shell)
├── R, RR, …                 # Global most-recent raw logs
└── E, EE, …                 # Global most-recent env logs
```

`S` always points to the most recent output, `SS` to the second most recent,
etc.  The `pids/` tree scopes these to a single shell session, so
`$ZENLOG_DIR/pids/$ZENLOG_PID/S` is your shell's last output even if another
shell ran a command in between.

### Log tagging

Add an inline comment to a command to create a named tag:

```bash
make -B    # full-build
```

Zenlog creates `$ZENLOG_DIR/tags/full-build/S` pointing to that run's output.

---

## Subcommands

### Session management

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `zenlog` | Start a new logged shell session |
| `zenlog init` | Interactive setup: create `~/.zenlog.toml` and patch shell RC |

| `zenlog flush` | Flush log buffers for the current session |
| `zenlog flush-all` | Flush log buffers for all sessions |
| `zenlog in-zenlog` | Exit 0 if running inside a zenlog session, 1 otherwise |

### Viewing logs

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `zenlog open-last-log [-r] [-e] [-p PID]` | Open previous command's log with `$ZENLOG_VIEWER` |
| `zenlog open-current-log [-r] [-e] [-p PID]` | Open current (most recent) command's log |
| `zenlog open-log` | Interactively pick a log with fzf and open it |
| `zenlog open-url` | Find URLs in recent logs, pick with fzf, open in browser |
| `zenlog cat-last-log` | Print previous command's log to stdout |
| `zenlog cat-last-log-content` | Same but strip the command-line header |

### Finding log files

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `zenlog history [-r] [-e] [-n N] [-p PID]` | Print recent log filenames (up to 10) |
| `zenlog current-log [-r] [-e] [-p PID]` | Print filename of the most recent log |
| `zenlog last-log [-r] [-e] [-p PID]` | Print filename of the second most recent log |
| `zenlog all-commands [-r] [-e] [-n DAYS] [-c] [-l]` | List all logs with their command lines |

**`zenlog history` flags:**
- `-r` — show RAW log filename instead of SAN
- `-e` — show ENV log filename instead of SAN
- `-n N` — show only the Nth most recent log (1 = most recent)
- `-p PID` — use a specific zenlog session PID instead of `$ZENLOG_PID`

**`zenlog all-commands` flags:**
- `-n DAYS` — limit to logs within the last N days (default: 30)
- `-c` — limit to the current session only
- `-l` — print filenames only, no command lines

**`zenlog purge-log` flags:**
- `-p DAYS` — (required) delete logs older than this many days
- `-y` — skip the confirmation prompt
- `-P` — dry run: print files that would be deleted instead of deleting them
- `-b` — run in the background

```bash
# Examples
zenlog purge-log -p 30          # Remove logs older than 30 days (asks for confirmation)
zenlog purge-log -p 90 -y       # Force-remove logs older than 90 days

### Scripting / internals

These are used by the shell hooks and scripts; you rarely need them directly.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `zenlog start-command [-e ENV] CMDLINE…` | Signal the logger that a command is starting |
| `zenlog end-command [-n]` | Signal the logger that the command finished |

| `zenlog check-bin-update` | Print a message if the binary was updated since session start |
| `zenlog list-logs [DIR]` | List the log directory tree (F=file, L=symlink) |

---

## Manual shell setup

If `zenlog init` doesn't cover your shell, add the setup line by hand.

**Bash** (add to `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
. <(zenlog basic-bash-setup)
```

**Zsh** (add to `~/.zshrc`):
```zsh
. <(zenlog basic-zsh-setup)
```

For any POSIX-compatible shell with preexec/postexec hooks, look at the output
of `zenlog basic-bash-setup` and adapt the hook wiring to your shell.

---

## How it works

Zenlog creates a PTY, starts your shell inside it, and tees all I/O through its
own logging goroutines.  Each command's output is separated by the `PS0` (Bash)
or `preexec` (Zsh) and `PROMPT_COMMAND` / `precmd` hooks.

Output is written to three parallel trees:

- **SAN** — ANSI escape sequences stripped (grep-friendly)
- **RAW** — byte-for-byte original output (color-accurate)
- **ENV** — metadata: working directory, git branch, exit status, timestamps

Symbolic links in `cmds/`, `pids/`, and `tags/` provide O(1) access to the
most recent N outputs per command, session, and tag.
